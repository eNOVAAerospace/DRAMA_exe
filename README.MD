----------

DRAMA_exe retrieves simulation data from the DRAMA software (v3.1 and v3.5) and generates .xlsx and .kml files to facilitate visualization.

The .xlsx file allows for the storage and concatenation of DRAMA data. It contains an index page that groups the debris parentage tree, their shapes, and materials, as well as pages that group the flight data of each debris.

The .kml file is created from the data, allowing the visualization of the debris trajectories up to their impact points over time in Google Earth PRO.

## How to : data_retriever.exe

You will see a program named "Start.exe" in your file explorer. Keep in mind to not move any file to prevent its non functionnality. If you want an icon on the desktop, create a shortcut via right-click, but do not move the file from its directory.
